          COCO is a small coffee-colored teddy dog. Because its black round eyes
          and nose look like three buttons, I named its “Button” in Chinese.

      <p>
        And the pronunciation of COCO is similar to the pronunciation of the button in
        Chinese. I have always dreamed of owning a puppy since I was a child,
        and on one of my birthdays COCO came to my home. I first met COCO when
        he was a little guy curled up in the corner of his cage, and I decided
        right then and there that I wanted to take him home.
