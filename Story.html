            When Coco was a kid, it used to tear paper towels with its mouth,
            scattering scraps all over the floor. Once when my mother caught it,
            it ran up the stairs and stuck its head out to confront her.

        <p class="S2">
          When my parents came to pick me up from school, I could see COCO in
          the car. It would lie in the back of the car waiting for me to get in,
          and when I opened the door it would throw itself on top of me to
          welcome me. If COCO did not come to pick me up, it will obediently
          wait for me to go home at the door.

          What is very shocking to me is that COCO knows the time and it knows
          when COCO does , and when I go out it will always cry in the house. If
          I go out at a normal time, he will go back to sleep in his nest.

          COCO's favorite thing to play with is the ball. It likes to put the
          ball in your hand and wait for you to throw it. No matter how far you
          throw the ball it will take the ball back to your hand again and wait
          for you to continue to throw the ball, so over and over again
          tirelessly.

        COCO is a great companion dog, no matter what you are doing he will
        quietly lie aside and keep you company. When I was tired of doing my
        homework and saw COCO on the sofa with a happy face, and seeing its
        cute face was like a stimulant to keep me going.

        Every time you take a picture with COCO, it will be very cooperative
        to open its mouth and smile at the camera. I took a picture with my
        dog when I first arrived home last year, and he was very excited to
        see me, so he left a happy smile in front of the camera again.

      <p class="S7">
        Unlike other puppies, COCO is very clean. Every time it returns home 
        after an activity outside it will wait dutifully for the j family to 
        scrub its paws and body. When bathing, he will not run around and stand 
        in the bath waiting to be washed.

      <h3 class="S8">· Strange sleeping dog</h3>
      <p class="S8">
        COCO sleeping posture is fun, it will be a variety of strange poses to
         make people feel very funny. It often likes to lie flat on its belly 
         to sleep, from the book that when the puppies think it is in a very 
         safe environment will show their belly. COCO also hides under the 
         covers in winter, and when I return to the bedroom I find a puppy 
         waiting for me under the covers.
